**Welcome to my Khan Academy SQL Projects. This repository contains my SQL code for all the Khan Academy SQL projects that I have completed.**




**The first project is my code for Khan Academy's design, a Store Database Project. Here I created a Bookstore with fifteen different books: their prices, ratings, how many books has the store sold, how many books does the store have in inventory. The project answers the questions of average ratings of the book, the price range of books from highest to lowest, which books the store needs to restock**
